* `ptpython` - my favorite Python REPL (NOTE: I don't recommend using this since it does not support for all of Python's command-line args)
* `VS-code` - my favorite text editor
* `WindowsPowerShell` - the best command line tool for Windows 
* `chocolatey` - for getting my favorite software installed on Windows machines, quick and easy
